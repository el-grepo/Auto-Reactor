## You will need:

  The mods technic, mesecons, digilines, pipeworks and their dependencies; as well as dynamic_liquid for the pump to actually flood the reactor and WorldEdit or some way of loading the schem file.

## Notes:
  The reactor alarm klaxon will almost definitely sound during activation. Maybe even twice.
